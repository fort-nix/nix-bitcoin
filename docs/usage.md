### Requirements Android
* Android phone
* [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/) installed from [F-Droid](https://guardianproject.info/fdroid) (recommended) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&hl=en)
* [Electrum mobile app](https://electrum.org/#home) 4.0.1 and newer installed from [direct download](https://electrum.org/#download) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electrum.electrum)

### Requirements Desktop
* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) installed from [source](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en) or [repository](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en)
* [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#download) installed

1. Enable electrs in `configuration.nix`

    Change
    ```
    # services.electrs.enable = true;
    ```
    to
    ```
    services.electrs.enable = true;
    ```

2. Deploy new `configuration.nix`

    ```
    nixops deploy -d bitcoin-node
    ```

3. Get electrs onion address

    ```
    nodeinfo | grep 'ELECTRS_ONION'
    ```

4. Connect to electrs

    Make sure Tor is running on Desktop or as Orbot on Android.

    On Desktop
    ```
    electrum --oneserver -1 -s "<ELECTRS_ONION>:50001:t" -p socks5:localhost:9050
    ```

    On Android
    ```
    Three dots in the upper-right-hand corner
    Network > Proxy mode: socks5, Host: 127.0.0.1, Port: 9050
    Network > Auto-connect: OFF
    Network > One-server mode: ON
    Network > Server: <ELECTRS_ONION>:50001:t
    ```

Connect to nix-bitcoin node through ssh Tor Hidden Service
---
1. Run `nodeinfo` on your nix-bitcoin node and note the `SSHD_ONION`

    ```
    nixops ssh operator@bitcoin-node
    nodeinfo | grep 'SSHD_ONION'
    ```

2. Create a SSH key

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

3. Place the ed25519 key's fingerprint in the `configuration.nix` `openssh.authorizedKeys.keys` field like so

    ```
    # FIXME: Add your SSH pubkey
    services.openssh.enable = true;
    users.users.root = {
      openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [ "[contents of ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub]" ];
    };
    ```

4. Connect to your nix-bitcoin node's ssh Tor Hidden Service, forwarding a local port to the nix-bitcoin node's ssh server

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -L [random port of your choosing]:localhost:22 root@[your SSHD_ONION]
    ```

5. Edit your `network-nixos.nix` to look like this

    ```
    {
      bitcoin-node =
        { config, pkgs, ... }:
        { deployment.targetHost = "127.0.0.1";
        deployment.targetPort = [random port of your choosing];
        };
    }
    ```

6. Now you can run `nixops deploy -d bitcoin-node` and it will connect through the ssh tunnel you established in step iv. This also allows you to do more complex ssh setups that `nixops ssh` doesn't support. An example would be authenticating with [Trezor's ssh agent](https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent), which provides extra security.

Initialize a Trezor for Bitcoin Core's Hardware Wallet Interface
---

1. Enable Trezor in `configuration.nix`

    Change
    ```
    # services.hardware-wallets.trezor = true;
    ```
    to
    ```
    services.hardware-wallets.trezor = true;
    ```

2. Deploy new `configuration.nix`

    ```
    nixops deploy -d bitcoin-node
    ```

3. Check that your nix-bitcoin node recognizes your Trezor

    ```
    nixops ssh operator@bitcoin-node
    lsusb
    ```
    Should show something relating to your Trezor

4. If your Trezor has outdated firmware or is not yet initialized: Start your Trezor in bootloader mode

    Trezor v1
    ```
    Plug in your Trezor with both buttons depressed
    ```

    Trezor v2
    ```
    Start swiping your finger across your Trezor's touchscreen and plug in the USB cable when your finger is halfway through
    ```

5. If your Trezor's firmware is outdated: Update your Trezor's firmware

    ```
    trezorctl firmware-update
    ```
    Follow the on-screen instructions

    **Caution: This command _will_ wipe your Trezor. If you already store Bitcoin on it, only do this with the recovery seed nearby.**

6. If your Trezor is not yet initialized: Set up your Trezor

    ```
    trezorctl reset-device -p
    ```
    Follow the on-screen instructions

7. Find your Trezor

    ```
    hwi enumerate
    hwi -t trezor -d <path from previous command> promptpin
    hwi -t trezor -d <path> sendpin <number positions for the PIN as displayed on your device's screen>
    hwi enumerate
    ```

8. Follow Bitcoin Core's instructions on [Using Bitcoin Core with Hardware Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/master/docs/bitcoin-core-usage.md) to use your Trezor with `bitcoin-cli` on your nix-bitcoin node
