  ### BITCOIND
  # Bitcoind is enabled by default if nix-bitcoin is enabled
  #
  # Enable this option to set pruning to a specified MiB value.
  # clightning is compatible with pruning. See
  # https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/#pruning for more information.
  # LND and electrs are not compatible with pruning.

  ### CLIGHTNING
  # Enable this module to use clightning, a Lightning Network implementation
  # in C.

  # offers outgoing functionality, but doesn't announce the Tor Hidden Service
  # under which peers can reach us.

  ### LND
  # Disable clightning and uncomment the following line in order to enable lnd,
  # a lightning implementation written in Go.
  # services.lnd.enable = true;
  # Enable this option to announce our Tor Hidden Service. By default lnd
  # offers outgoing functionality, but doesn't announce the Tor Hidden Service
  # under which peers can reach us.

  ## WARNING
  # If you use lnd, you should manually backup your wallet mnemonic
  # seed. This will allow you to recover on-chain funds. You can run the
  # following command after the lnd service starts:
  # nixops scp --from bitcoin-node /secrets/lnd-seed-mnemonic ./secrets/lnd-seed-mnemonic
  # You should also backup your channel state after opening new channels.
  # This will allow you to recover off-chain funds, by force-closing channels.
  # nixops scp --from bitcoin-node /var/lib/lnd/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup /my-backup-path/channel.backup

  ### SPARK WALLET
  # Enable this module to use spark-wallet, a minimalistic wallet GUI for
  # c-lightning, accessible over the web or through mobile and desktop apps.
  # Only available if clightning is enabled.

  # settlement network linking together cryptocurrency exchanges and
  # institutions around the world. Liquid is accessed with the elements-cli
  # tool run as user operator.

  ### LIGHTNING CHARGE
  # Enable this module to use lightning-charge, a simple drop-in solution for
  # accepting lightning payments. Only available if clightning is enabled.

  # lightning-charge are enabled.
  # services.nanopos.enable = true;

  ### WEBINDEX
  # Enable this module to use the nix-bitcoin-webindex, a simple website

  # if clightning, lightning-charge, and nanopos are enabled.
  # services.nix-bitcoin-webindex.enable = true;

  ### RECURRING-DONATIONS
  # Enable this module to send recurring donations. This is EXPERIMENTAL; it's
  # not guaranteed that payments are succeeding or that you will notice payment
  # failure. Only available if clightning is enabled.
  # services.recurring-donations.enable = true;
  # Specify the receivers of the donations. By default donations are every

  ### Hardware wallets
  # Enable this module to allow using hardware wallets. See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI

  # Ledger must be initialized through the official ledger live app and the Bitcoin app must
  # be installed and running on the device.

  ### netns-isolation (EXPERIMENTAL)
  # Enable this module to use Network Namespace Isolation. This feature places
  # every service in its own network namespace and only allows truly necessary
  # connections between network namespaces, making sure services are isolated on
  # a network-level as much as possible.
  # nix-bitcoin.netns-isolation.enable = true;

  ### lightning-loop
  # Enable this module to use lightninglab's non-custodial off/on chain bridge.
