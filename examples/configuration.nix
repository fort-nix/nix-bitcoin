  # See ../README.md (Features → clightning) for the list of available plugins.
  # services.clightning.plugins.prometheus.enable = true;
  #
  # == REST server
  # Set this to create a clightning REST onion service.
  # This also adds binary `lndconnect-onion-clightning` to the system environment.
  # This binary creates QR codes or URLs for connecting applications to clightning
  # via the REST onion service (see ../docs/services.md).
  #
  # services.clightning-rest = {

  ### LND
  # Set this to enable lnd, a lightning implementation written in Go.
  # services.lnd.enable = true;
  #
  # NOTE: In order to avoid collisions with clightning you must disable clightning or
  # change the services.clightning.port or services.lnd.port to a port other than
  # 9735.

  # Set this to create an onion service by which lnd can accept incoming connections
  # via Tor.

  #
  ## WARNING
  # If you use lnd, you should manually backup your wallet mnemonic
  # seed. This will allow you to recover on-chain funds. You can run the
  # following commands after the lnd service starts:
  #   mkdir -p ./backups/lnd/
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/lnd-seed-mnemonic ./backups/lnd/
  #
  # You should also backup your channel state after opening new channels.
  # This will allow you to recover off-chain funds, by force-closing channels.
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup ./backups/lnd/
  #
  # Alternatively, you can have these files backed up by services.backups below.

  ### BTCPayServer
  # Set this to enable BTCPayServer, a self-hosted, open-source
  # cryptocurrency payment processor.
  # services.btcpayserver.enable = true;
  #
  # Privacy Warning: BTCPayServer currently looks up price rates without

  # The lightning backend service is automatically enabled.
  # Afterwards you need to go into Store > General Settings > Lightning Nodes
  # and select "the internal lightning node of this BTCPay Server".
  #
  # Set this to create an onion service to make the btcpayserver web interface
  # accessible via Tor.
  # Security WARNING: Create a btcpayserver administrator account before allowing
  # public access to the web interface.

  # clearing-price auction for Lightning Channel Leases.
  # services.lightning-pool.enable = true;
  #
  # Use the `pool` command to interact with the lightning-pool service.
  # Automatically enables lnd.

  # lightning-pool requires that lnd has a publicly reachable address.
  # Set this to create a public onion service for lnd.
  # nix-bitcoin.onionServices.lnd.public = true;

  ### charge-lnd
  # Set this to enable charge-lnd, a simple policy based fee manager for

  # Note: JoinMarket has full access to bitcoind, including its wallet functionality.
  # services.joinmarket.enable = true;

  # Set this to enable the JoinMarket order book watcher.

  # Supply the sftp password by appending the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable
  # to secrets/backup-encryption-env like so
  # `echo "FTP_PASSWORD=<password>" >> secrets/backup-encryption-env`
  # You many also need to set a ssh host and publickey with
  # programs.ssh.knownHosts."host" = {
  #   hostNames = [ "host" ];
  #   publicKey = "<ssh public from `ssh-keyscan`>";
  # };
  # If you also want to backup bulk data like the Bitcoin & Liquid blockchains
  # and electrs data directory, enable
  # services.backups.with-bulk-data = true;

  ### netns-isolation (EXPERIMENTAL)

  # every service in its own network namespace and only allows truly necessary
  # connections between network namespaces, making sure services are isolated on
  # a network-level as much as possible.
