  ### BITCOIND
  # Bitcoind is enabled by default if nix-bitcoin is enabled
  #

  ### LND
  # Uncomment the following line in order to enable lnd, a lightning

  # you must disable clightning or change the services.clightning.port or
  # services.lnd.port to a port other than 9735.

  #
  ## WARNING
  # If you use lnd, you should manually backup your wallet mnemonic
  # seed. This will allow you to recover on-chain funds. You can run the
  # following commands after the lnd service starts:
  #   mkdir -p ./backups/lnd/
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/lnd-seed-mnemonic ./backups/lnd/
  #
  # You should also backup your channel state after opening new channels.
  # This will allow you to recover off-chain funds, by force-closing channels.
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup ./backups/lnd/

  ### BTCPayServer
  # Enable this module to use BTCPayServer, a self-hosted, open-source
  # cryptocurrency payment processor.

  # proxying them through Tor. This means an outside observer can correlate

  # Set this to create an onion service to make the btcpayserver web interface

  ### LIQUIDD

  ### RECURRING-DONATIONS

  ### Hardware wallets
  # Enable this module to allow using hardware wallets. See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI

  ### Backups
  # Enable this module to use nix-bitcoin's own backups module. By default, it
  # uses duplicity to incrementally back up all important files in /var/lib to
  # /var/lib/localBackups once a day.
  # services.backups.enable = true;
  # You can pull the localBackups folder with

  # Alternatively, you can also set a remote target url, for example
  # services.backups.destination = "sftp://user@host[:port]/[relative|/absolute]_path";
  # Supply the sftp password by appending the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable
  # to secrets/backup-encryption-env like so
  # `echo "FTP_PASSWORD=<password>" >> secrets/backup-encryption-env`
  # You many also need to set a ssh host and publickey with
  # programs.ssh.knownHosts."host" = {
  #   hostNames = [ "host" ];
  #   publicKey = "<ssh public from `ssh-keyscan`>";
